## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic JavaScript

### What I Learned

In the process of building this basic JavaScript project, I gained valuable insights and skills, including:

- **HTML Structure:** Created the fundamental structure of a webpage using HTML, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, and images.

- **CSS Styling:** Applied styles to enhance the visual presentation of the project, including layout, colors, and fonts.

- **JavaScript Interactivity:** Implemented JavaScript to add interactivity to the webpage. This involved working with DOM manipulation to dynamically update content and respond to user actions.

- **Event Handling:** Learned how to handle user events, such as clicks, by attaching event listeners to specific HTML elements.
